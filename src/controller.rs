//! # PID-based Flight Stabilization Controller
//!
//! This module provides a direct no_std Rust translation of the PID stabilization from dRehmFlight
//! version 1.3, an Arduino-based PID flight controller, aimed at use in a single-threaded environment
//! for UAVs or similar vehicles. The translation has been done with the intent to keep the code as
//! close to the original as possible, allowing for easier verification and comparison by those familiar
//! with the Arduino implementation.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The code consists of functions that compute PID control commands based on sensor inputs and desired
//! flight parameters. Each function manages specific aspects of flight control—angle stabilization,
//! rate control, etc.—updating global mutable state that represents the system's outputs.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This module is intended for embedded systems where Rust's `no_std` environment is applicable.
//! It uses unsafe global variables to store state and outputs, reflecting the structure of the original
//! Arduino code. Each function is marked `unsafe` due to the direct manipulation of these global states,
//! which could lead to data races in a multithreaded context or other side effects due to improper use.
//!
//! ## Limitations and Concerns
//!
//! - **Global Mutable State:** The extensive use of `static mut` for storing system state is inherently
//!   unsafe and non-idiomatic in Rust. This approach was chosen to simplify the initial translation
//!   process but is prone to errors and issues in multi-threaded environments. Users must ensure that
//!   these functions are only accessed in a single-threaded context to prevent undefined behavior.
//!
//! - **Unsafe Code:** The reliance on unsafe code blocks is a significant concern for safety-critical
//!   applications typical of flight control systems. Future revisions should aim to encapsulate state
//!   management within safer abstractions and minimize or eliminate the use of `unsafe` by leveraging
//!   Rust's type and concurrency safety features.
//!
//! - **Flight Readiness:** The current architecture, heavily reliant on global state and unsafe practices,
//!   is not suitable for actual flight applications. It represents a fundamental mismatch with Rust's
//!   design principles, emphasizing safety and expressiveness through ownership and borrowing.
//!
//! ## Future Improvements
//!
//! Future improvements should focus on refactoring the code to embrace Rust's safety and concurrency
//! features, reducing the reliance on global mutable state, and implementing more robust error handling
//! and validation mechanisms. Additionally, exploring the use of Rust's async capabilities might provide
//! avenues for safer and more efficient concurrency models in multi-threaded or interrupt-driven contexts.
